# PerfJ

`PerfJ` is a wrapper of linux `perf` for java programs.

In order to profile java programs, you need a profiler that can sample stack traces. There has historically been two types of profilers:

* `System profilers:` like Linux perf, which shows system code paths (eg, JVM GC, syscalls, TCP), but not Java methods.
* `JVM profilers:` like hprof, LJP, and commercial profilers. These show Java methods, but usually not system code paths.

Ideally, we have profile result that does it all: system and Java code paths. Apart from convenience, it also shows system code-paths in Java context, which can be crucial for understanding a profile properly.

The problem is getting a system profiler to understand Java methods and stack traces. If you try Linux perf_events, for example, you'll see hexadecimal numbers and broken stack traces, as it can't convert addresses into Java symbols, and can't walk the JVM stack.

There are two specific problems:

* The JVM compiles methods on the fly (just-in-time: JIT), and doesn't expose a traditional symbol table for system profilers to read.
* The JVM also uses the frame pointer register (RBP on x86-64) as a general purpose register, breaking traditional stack walking.


Thanks to [Brendan Gregg's patch](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8068945). We will have an option to turn on the preservation of frame pointer on JDK 8u60+.

This project is based on Johannes Rudolph's work at [here](https://github.com/jrudolph/perf-map-agent). I just make it more convenient to use.

## Prerequisites

* Linux x86_64
* perf
* JDK 8u60+ / JDK9 ( haven't been release yet)

## Build

checkout the source from github
    git clone https://github.com/coderplay/perfj.git

    gradle releaseTarGz
or just run once

    gradle createWrapper
afterwards run

    ./gradlew releaseTarGz

## Usage

`PerfJ` is only work on new versions of JDK with frame pointer preserved. Here is an example shows how to enable this feature

    java -XX:+PreserveFramePointer ContextSwitchTest

After that, run perfj

    bin/perfj record -e sched:sched_switch -F 99 -g -p `pgrep -f ContextSwitchTest` sleep 5

We will see perf.data as well as /tmp/perf-$pid.map are generated by perfj on local disk. Finally, show the result

    bin/perfj report --stdio

Below is an example result

Now that you can see the Java/JVM methods rather than hexadecimal addresses.
